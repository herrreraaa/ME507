# TERMPROJECT
This is the code for my ME507 term project 

The main peices of interest are located in /Drivers.
There are 5 drivers which were written from scratch, which are the following:
    /Drivers/Encoder    (Tracks the rotation of a motor shaft)
    /Drivers/FollowLine (Contains a line following process using line sensors)
    /Drivers/LineSensor (Returns the state of a line sesnor)
    /Drivers/Ultrasonic (Measures pulse width from an ultrsonic sensor and returns distance away based on that pulse width)
    /Drivers/motor      (Interfaces with motors)
